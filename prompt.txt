we have a new bug we need help reproducing.

The recent release of c-core v5.1.0 appears to have broken pubnub_subscribe for us. The same code that was working for us on v5.0.3 no longer works on this newest version.
More specifically, pubnub_subscribe never returns once called. We always call it with a comma separated list of 2 channels and channel_group = NULL.
Here's the order in which we call the c-core functions leading up to the subscribe attempt:
pubnub_alloc
pubnub_init
pubnub_use_http_keep_alive
pubnub_set_user_id
pubnub_set_auth
pubnub_subscribe // Never returns on v5.1.0 or v5.1.1
pubnub_await
pubnub_get
When PUBNUB_LOG_LEVEL is set to PUBNUB_LOG_LEVEL_TRACE, it only shows:
pbpal_init()
pbntf_setup()
for the pubnub_init call.
Also note that pubnub_publish works fine for us.
I'm eager to update to v5.1.1 because it appears to resolve an problem we've been seeing occasionally, so hopefully we can resolve this subscribe issue soon.
