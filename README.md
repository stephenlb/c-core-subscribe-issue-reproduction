[2025-07-07 12:28:33] Step 6: Calling pubnub_await...
[2025-07-07 12:28:33] pubnub_await returned with result: 0
[2025-07-07 12:28:33] ✓ Subscribe completed successfully
```

**Test Results Summary**:
- **Setup**: ✅ PubNub C-Core v5.1.1 downloaded and compiled successfully
- **Compilation**: ✅ Reproduction program compiled with 2 warnings (unused variables)
- **Execution Time**: < 1 second
- **pubnub_subscribe()** returned `PNR_STARTED` (14) immediately ✅
- **pubnub_await()** completed with `PNR_OK` (0) ✅
- **No hanging behavior observed** ✅
- **Publish test**: ❌ Failed with result 0 (expected for demo keys without valid auth)

## Reproduction Program Details

### Exact API Call Sequence (Matches User Report)
```c
pubnub_t *ctx = pubnub_alloc();                    // ✅
pubnub_init(ctx, "demo", "demo");                  // ✅
pubnub_use_http_keep_alive(ctx);                   // ✅
pubnub_set_user_id(ctx, "bug_reproduction_user");  // ✅
pubnub_set_auth(ctx, "test_auth_key");             // ✅
pubnub_subscribe(ctx, "test_channel_1,test_channel_2", NULL);  // ✅
pubnub_await(ctx);                                 // ✅
pubnub_get(ctx);                                   // ✅
```

### Key Parameters (Matches User Report)
- **Channels**: `"test_channel_1,test_channel_2"` (comma-separated list of 2 channels) ✅
- **Channel Group**: `NULL` ✅
- **Logging**: `PUBNUB_LOG_LEVEL_TRACE` enabled ✅

### Safety Features Implemented
- **Timeout Protection**: 10-second transaction timeout to prevent infinite hanging
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful exit on Ctrl+C
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Timestamped debug output at each step
- **Error Code Interpretation**: Detailed result code analysis

## Analysis

### Why the Bug Might Not Be Reproducing

1. **Platform Differences**: 
   - User environment (likely Linux/embedded) vs test environment (macOS)
   - Different networking stack behavior

2. **Build Configuration**:
   - Different compiler flags or preprocessor definitions
   - Threading model differences (`PUBNUB_THREADSAFE` settings)
   - Memory allocation strategy differences

3. **Network Environment**:
   - Corporate proxy/firewall settings
   - Network latency or connectivity issues
   - DNS resolution differences

4. **Runtime Conditions**:
   - System resource constraints
   - Multi-threading race conditions
   - Memory pressure scenarios

### Evidence Supporting Bug Existence

1. **User's Specific Environment**: Bug may be environment-specific
2. **Version Timing**: Issue appeared specifically in v5.1.1, suggesting architectural changes
3. **Configuration Dependencies**: Different build configurations may trigger the issue

## Deliverables

### Files Created
1. **`pubnub_subscribe_bug_reproduction.c`**: Complete reproduction program
2. **`setup_and_test.sh`**: Automated setup and compilation script
3. **`Makefile`**: Build configuration with all necessary PubNub source files
4. **`COMPILE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**: Comprehensive compilation guide
5. **`README_RESULTS.md`**: Detailed test results and analysis

### Compilation Instructions
```bash
# Quick setup (downloads PubNub C-Core v5.1.1 and compiles)
./setup_and_test.sh

# Run the reproduction test
./setup_and_test.sh --run
```

## Recommendations

### For Bug Investigation
1. **Test in User's Environment**: Run the reproduction case in the exact environment where the bug occurs
2. **Configuration Comparison**: Compare build flags and compile-time options
3. **Network Analysis**: Test under different network conditions
4. **Threading Analysis**: Examine threading model and race conditions

### For PubNub Development Team
1. **Platform Testing**: Test across different platforms (Linux, embedded systems)
2. **Regression Testing**: Compare behavior between v5.0.3 and v5.1.1
3. **Configuration Testing**: Test different build configurations and preprocessor definitions
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation regarding known issues and workarounds

## Conclusion

**✅ Reproduction case successfully created and tested**  
**⚠️ Bug not reproduced in current test environment**  
**🔍 Suggests environment-specific or configuration-specific issue**

The reproduction program is ready for deployment and testing in the user's specific environment where the bug was originally observed. The comprehensive logging and error handling will help identify the exact point of failure when the bug is triggered.

**Next Steps**: Deploy the reproduction case in the user's environment to capture the hanging behavior and detailed trace logs for further analysis.
